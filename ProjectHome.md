## Description ##
wp-ajax-newsletter is a Wordpress plugin that allows users to subscribe and receive a newsletter containing the blog latest posts.

## Features ##
Currently, it supports sending a newsletter:
  * Automatically after a specified amount of posts are published
  * On a monthly or weekly basis
  * Manually from the back-office

Users subscribe to the newsletter in the front-office, using an Ajax component, and are not required to be registered. Subscriptions must be validated either by an administrator, in the back-office, or by using a link provided in the confirmation email. Additionally, users can also unsubscribe using a quick link.

In the back-office, the newsletter can be customized with a header, footer, subject, and with a template for displaying posts (with real-time preview). The list of subscribers is also available with some basic functionality: activate and delete.

## Requirements ##
  * Wordpress 2.0x or 2.1
  * MySQL version 4.1 or greater
  * Javascript enabled
